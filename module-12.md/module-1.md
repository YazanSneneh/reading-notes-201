# Intro to cross-platform development with flutter and dart
## topcis:
    - Cross-Platform. 
    - What is flutter.
    - Why use flutter for development.
    - 1 code base.
    - The flutter layout system vs android and ios layout system.
    - Hot Reload.
    - Flutter Application Anatomy.

- Cross platform allow me to build android & ios applications with the same codebase.
- Flutter is a technology created by google so I can use it to build android, ios, web applications and  using dart.

### What Is Flutter?
-  If I create a native mobile application with android and ios.
   - the codebase is doubled:
     - because I need code for android using java and codebase for ios using objective c.
     - Also when new feature added on android must be written again on ios.

- Make a layout design for different screen sizes it quit hard because a lot of android devices made by many companies.

##### **Flutter**
- like I mentioned earlier, one codebase allow me to make andorid, ios and web appliation which is make things easier.
- flutter is a toolkit allow me to develop interfaces easily for all screen sizes and devices.
- it come with pre-built widgets to make app layout easy like centering elements and paddings.
- flutter require a blank screen to start working on it (web, android or ios) and flutter start drawing.
- also I can specify how it look on android and look on ios app differently like it's almost ios app.
- using these widgets can make me build android ios web or desktop apps.
- so basically the app is group of widgets in flutter I use.
**- by using these widgets I can create an application that look almost like native applications and on different screen sizes using one codebase and without learning new technology.**

### Why choose Flutter to build a project?
 - **1 code base, 1 code to debug and one code to update.**
 - **learn only one thing to develop which is dart.**
   - normally i need java and android for android development, swift and objective-c for ios apps, web language for web apps and desktop langauge for desktop apps.
   - here i need to know only dart.

 - **Simple layout system, the idea of dealing with layout is coming from web responsive design.**
   - in order for developer to make sure that user get most out of screen user experience and elements on screen.
   - constraints are used to create layout.
   - flutter inspired by the web way to deal with layout on different screen sizes. 
   - the web have very powerful way to deal with screens
   - this is very important because when working with android it have a lot of screen sizes, tablets, and a lot more.
   - making design for each one.

- **Hot Reload** unlike android and ios Flutter uses Hot reload, it may take very long time to rerun app around 30s.
  - a mechanism where i dont have to re-run my application while developing.
  - with flutter as i am updating and saving my app data will appear on screen directly. 

- **Open source** means i can see how the code written by google flutter team and see how it works.
  - i can take their code and edit it for my needs.
